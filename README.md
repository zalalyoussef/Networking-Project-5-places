This project undertakes the design, modeling, and simulation of a network infrastructure tailored for educational institutions across five cities. Utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer, a robust network simulation tool, it configures IP ranges to meet the unique requirements of public, administrative, and server networks within each institution.

Central to the project is the goal of ensuring reliable and secure connectivity across all networks. By strategically applying subnetting, the project efficiently allocates IP addresses to optimize network performance. Logical subnet segmentation allows each school's infrastructure to remain resilient, scalable, and suited to both academic and administrative needs.

Key methodologies include designing network topologies specific to each segment's needs, selecting subnet masks to establish network boundaries, prevent IP conflicts, and make the most of available IP addresses. The project extends beyond theoretical design, incorporating simulations to test network functionality and stability through Cisco Packet Tracer, enabling visualization and refinement before real-world deployment.

Additionally, the project prioritizes security and accessibility, with a focus on integrating wireless connectivity to support the unique needs of the school networks.
